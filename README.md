# Linear Support Vector Classifiers (SVM)

This project demonstrates the implementation and usage of a Linear SVM for binary classification tasks.

SVMs are supervised learning models used for classification and regression analysis. This project focuses on classification by finding the optimal hyperplane that separates data points of two different classes by first training a linear SVM and then testing its ability to classify new, unseen data points correctly.
