# projects

This repository contains a collection of projects done at university or in my free time. In the following, for each of them a very short and simple introduction will be given.

# Linear Support Vector Classifiers (LinearSVC)

This project demonstrates the implementation and usage of a Linear SVC for binary classification tasks.

SVMs are supervised learning models used for classification and regression analysis. This project focuses on classification by finding the optimal hyperplane that separates data points of two different classes by first training a linear SVM and then testing its ability to classify new, unseen data points correctly. 


# Non-Linear Support Vector Classifiers (NonLinearSVC)

This project also demonstrates the implementation and usage of a Non-Linear SVC for binary classification tasks.

Non-linear SVMs extend the capabilities of linear SVMs by using kernel functions to map data points into higher-dimensional spaces where a linear separator can be used. This approach allows the SVM to handle more complex datasets that are not linearly separable.
