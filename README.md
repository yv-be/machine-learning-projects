# projects

This repository contains a collection of projects done at university or in my free time. In the following, for each of them a very short and simple introduction will be given.

# Organization and Fun Apps Webpage

My web page is a personal project that I started for fun and for the purpose of learning new things. It has been hosted on the Vercel Cloud Platform and is a continuous project that is still under construction. However, the project is constantly updated and improved, so stay tuned! 

# Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Image Classification

This project demonstrates the implementation and usage of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image classification tasks (Handwritten Digits in this case). 

CNNs are a class of deep learning models particularly effective for image recognition and classification. They are designed to automatically and adaptively learn spatial hierarchies of features from input images through the use of convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers.

# Linear Support Vector Classifiers (LinearSVC)

This project demonstrates the implementation and usage of a Linear SVC for binary classification tasks.

SVMs are supervised learning models used for classification and regression analysis. This project focuses on classification by finding the optimal hyperplane that separates data points of two different classes by first training a linear SVM and then testing its ability to classify new, unseen data points correctly. 


# Non-Linear Support Vector Classifiers (NonLinearSVC)

This project also demonstrates the implementation and usage of a Non-Linear SVC for binary classification tasks.

Non-linear SVMs extend the capabilities of linear SVMs by using kernel functions to map data points into higher-dimensional spaces where a linear separator can be used. This approach allows the SVM to handle more complex datasets that are not linearly separable.
